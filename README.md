# JNTU Guide App

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main aim of this app is to create a ecosystem for all the students where they can share all the books,question papers,notes and other stuff related to the education. So that as they days go on there will be huge data base for the future students who join college in the comming years. There wont be any need of searching the web for the softcopies of the books and notes as every thing will already be available with in the app contributed by someone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Idea of developing this came from senario where there is no availablility of previous year question papers as they are not made available to the students by the institution it self. So the only way of gathering them is to consult seniors. But if there is facility where every one contribute the resources that are useful and every one who are within the app can view it will make it easier to maintain a database of all the required content and this will keep on growing as days proceed.
<br>
As of now, the app is still under-development.<br><br>
